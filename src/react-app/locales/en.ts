    "Lefkada (Lefkas) is a beautiful Greek island in the Ionian Sea, known for its turquoise waters, stunning beaches, and charming villages. Welcome to your guide for exploring Lefkada!",
  travelTitle: "Lefkada Beaches & Travel Info",
  travelGeneral: `Lefkada’s most beautiful beaches are on the western coast of the island with dramatic cliffs, clear turquoise waters, and mostly pebbles or sand. These beaches are not within walking distance of towns like Lefkada City or Komilio — a car is essential. Roads can be narrow and winding, especially near cliff viewpoints and parking areas, but they are generally passable by standard car. Some beaches require steps or short hikes down from parking.`,
